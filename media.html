            &ldquo;As I was growing up, I was very impatient within myself and I couldn’t really concentrate well on things.
            Through origami, my patience started growing and my concentration level increased with it. Origami has 
            now become like a form of meditation to me. For instance, whenever I get stressed or frustrated, 
            it is the one thing that calms me down. Normally, every time I make something new, my entire 
            intention behind it is to give it to friends and family as a gift, keeping in mind what they would like. 
            I don’t personally own all of my models at the moment.&rdquo;

            For him, making origami is like meditating. &ldquo;When I start folding papers at night after finishing all 
            of my work for the day, all of my stress gets relieved,” says Rajbhandari. “As someone who started 
            origami as a hobby years ago, now it has become a part of me. When I fold papers with a motive of making 
            something, it feels like I am meditating, focusing my whole energy with full discipline, to create 
            something that becomes a medium of my expression.&rdquo;

            &ldquo;Origami&rdquo;, the paper fold artworks, Nepali artists, Ms. Yamuna Shrestha and Mr. Saugat Rajbhandari 
            showcased their beautiful origami 3D art works. Origami workshops by two artists were held for local 
            students. More than 400 students participated and learned about Japanese origami art. The exhibition 
            attracted visitors to enjoy traditional Japanese paintings and origami art. During the 14-day of 
            exhibition, about 800 art lovers visited our embassy hall.

            &ldquo;I thought 3D models were beautiful. I suddenly felt an urge to make them so I did,&rdquo; he says. In the 
            beginning, the folds of his paper triangles were clumsy and wrongly proportioned. He needed thousands 
            of triangles so it did seem like an impossible dream when starting out and he also found it difficult 
            to stay put at a certain place for long. &ldquo;With the 3D models you don’t see the final product right from 
            the beginning. A lot of work goes into making the paper triangles. It got really frustrating in the 
            beginning,&rdquo; he admits.
