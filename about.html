        <p class="abouttxt"> I was never an exceptional artist but weighed down by constant disappointments I looked 
          for a way out, I wanted to engage in and do something creative and constructive. I stumbled upon paper folding art 
          in the year 2011 and since then, origami has become a means of relief for me. This “seemingly childish” 
          (what most people like to call it) pastime has opened my mind to simple truth; that failure and disappointment 
          can be folded away if I learn from them and grow - that it is important to face obstacles to understand oneself.
          <br><br>
          Think about it, what do we usually do when things don’t go our way? WE FOLD! We give in for the moment, for 
          that particular deal, like in a game of cards. That is why I fold paper as hobby – the beauty of a new 
          beginning, the possibilities are infinite. Through the valleys and mountains of the folds, all that matters 
          is the puzzle of folding and assembling. Engrossed in the process, the mind breathes like freshly spaded 
          garden and the soul ironically unfolds. Nothing seems like a waste. It’s a form of meditation. It’s powerful, 
          the attempt to create something with one’s bare hands.
          <br><br>
          <b><i>[Origami (折り紙, Japanese pronunciation: [oɾiɡami] or [oɾiꜜɡami], from ori meaning "folding", and kami 
          meaning "paper" (kami changes to gami due to rendaku) is the art of paper folding, which is often associated 
          with Japanese culture. In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding 
          practices, regardless of their culture of origin.]</i></b>
          <br><br>
          My forte is 3D Origami, also called Golden Venture Origami, a type of Modular Origami. Here, paper measuring 
          3cm*5cm is folded into a simple triangular unit. Thousands of these units are inserted into one another to 
          create elaborate sculptures. The number of units needed depends on the level of complexity and the size of 
          the model. Typically, it would take 1,600 to 2,000 units to make a swan of 6 to 7 inches in height. So far, 
          the highest number I have used to finish a model is 17,000 paper triangle units.
          <br><br>
          Besides regular 3d Origami models, I design 3d Origami figurines of people/Gods and Goddesses, and their 
          stories told with paper art have been successful across online and print. My 3d Origami models and figurines 
          have been displayed at the art exhibition at the Embassy of Japan, Nepal (2019). 
          <br><br>
          It is quite simple in its approach; tools: hands, medium: paper. Yet, a world of artistic expression lies 
          within the humble confines of sheets of paper, triangles of papers. Origami and its branches are a great 
          stress buster - folding and assembling models is soothing. The sense of accomplishment is immensely 
          satisfying and certainly a lot of fun. 3d Origami has taught me to be compassionate and patient. 
          Every new project, new model, new figurine is a new opportunity to light a spark.
          <br><br>
          The wisdom of paper is in its simplicity. While the simple mountain-valley folds look beautiful, the art 
          gets infinitely more complex when a living form - human being is represented with sheets and triangles of 
          paper. From folding paper in all isolation to folding for a community of 3d Origami enthusiasts; from 
          assembling palm-sized models to folding almost 3 feet tall figurines; it’s been a long, eventful and 
          thoroughly enjoyable journey. In particular, over the years I have developed my own style of 3d Origami and 
          expressive 3d Origami Figurines.
          <br><br>
          My 3d Origami art page, “The Origami Guy” is a homage to the ancient art of paper folding. I hope my work 
          will give you a glimpse of how I see the world. I want you to see the simple beauty and elegance of the 
          models and also think about how the shapes are constructed from thousands of paper triangles.
          <br><br>
          Have fun going through my musings and original figurines!
